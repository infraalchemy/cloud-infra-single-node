# Kubernetes Migration Post-Mortem

Deploying a complex, multi-tier stateful application like Moodle into a local Kubernetes cluster introduced several architectural challenges involving networking, storage, initialization, and application configuration.

## 1. The Ghost Port Blockade & Local Network Conflict (Windows Layer & Cluster Configuration)

* **The Problem:** I encountered a flat refusal to connect on `localhost`. Running a process trace revealed zombie background instances of `com.docker.backend.exe` and `wslrelay.exe` holding host ports 80 and 443. Additionally, my initial KinD cluster configuration exposed secure traffic through host port `443`, which conflicted with the local cluster networking configuration.

* **The Fix:** I cleared stale Docker Desktop and WSL2 networking state using `Stop-Process` and `wsl --shutdown`. I then recreated the KinD cluster with updated port mappings, moving secure web traffic to host port `8443` while keeping the Kubernetes cluster networking isolated.

```yaml
hostPort: 80          # HTTP traffic
hostPort: 8443        # HTTPS traffic moved away from host port 443
```

## 2. Ingress Traffic Redirection Loops (Ingress Rules Layer)

* **The Problem:** Even with ports unblocked, local browser traffic was being redirected into SSL/TLS loops, preventing successful HTTP-based application testing.

* **The Fix:** I disabled the Nginx Ingress controller's automatic SSL redirect behavior by adding annotations to `ingress.yaml`, allowing local HTTP traffic to reach the application without forced HTTPS redirection.

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: "false"
```

## 3. FastCGI Connection Timeout Drops (Nginx Configuration Tier)

* **The Problem:** During the Moodle installation database population phase, backend PHP execution exceeded the default Nginx timeout thresholds. The reverse proxy terminated long-running requests before database initialization completed.

* **The Fix:** I modified the Nginx server block configuration to increase FastCGI timeout values, allowing long-running Moodle installation and database migration tasks to complete successfully.

```nginx
fastcgi_read_timeout 600s;
fastcgi_send_timeout 600s;
```

## 4. The Isolated Container Network Lock (PHP-FPM Topology)


* **The Problem:** Nginx successfully received web traffic, but PHP requests failed when forwarding to PHP-FPM. Investigation showed PHP-FPM was configured to listen only on `127.0.0.1:9000`. Since Nginx and PHP-FPM run in separate containers, PHP-FPM was not reachable through the container network.

* **The Fix:** I validated the issue by modifying the PHP-FPM listener at runtime. After confirming the root cause, I moved the configuration change into the Docker build process so the PHP-FPM network configuration was applied consistently during image creation.

```dockerfile
# Configure PHP-FPM for container network communication
RUN sed -i 's/listen = 127.0.0.1:9000/listen = 9000/g' /usr/local/etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf
```

## 5. The HTML Web Page Download Trap (Init Container Storage Pipeline)

* **The Problem:** The Moodle PHP pod became stuck in an `Init:Error` state. Reviewing the initialization container logs showed that the download process retrieved HTML page content instead of the Moodle application archive, causing the extraction process (`tar`) to fail.

* **The Fix:** I updated the `initContainers` configuration in `deployment.yaml` to use the direct Moodle archive URL with redirect handling enabled. I then removed the corrupted Persistent Volume Claim (`moodle-pvc`) so the initialization process could restart with clean storage.

```bash
# Fixed: Uses the explicit direct tarball URL with redirect handling
wget --max-redirect=5 -O moodle.tgz "https://download.moodle.org/download.php/direct/stable404/moodle-latest-404.tgz"
```

---

## 6. The Application Resource Deprivation Barrier (Application Optimization)

* **The Problem:** Inspection of the PHP runtime configuration showed the default container memory allocation was limited to `128M`. Moodle requires additional resources during initial installation to process directory indexing and database table creation.

* **The Fix:** I added a custom PHP configuration override (`moodle.ini`) during the Docker image build process to increase the runtime limits:

```ini
memory_limit=512M
max_execution_time=300
```

---

## 7. The Hidden Worker Node Redirection (Ingress Routing Scheduling)

* **The Problem:** Every application pod reported healthy, yet browser requests still returned `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE`. Investigation showed that Kubernetes had scheduled the `ingress-nginx-controller` pod onto the `lab-worker` node. In the local KinD environment, Windows host port mappings were attached only to the `lab-control-plane` node, causing external traffic to reach a node without the ingress controller.

* **The Fix:** I updated the ingress controller deployment scheduling rules to force the `ingress-nginx-controller` pod onto the control-plane node using a `nodeSelector` and control-plane toleration. This aligned the external traffic entry point with the ingress routing layer.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx -o wide -w

kubectl patch deployment ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx \
-p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"nodeSelector":{"ingress-ready":"true"},"tolerations":[{"key":"node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane","operator":"Exists","effect":"NoSchedule"}]}}}}'
```
