# Local Kubernetes Deployment Guide

This document contains the step-by-step commands used to build, deploy, verify, and rebuild the local Kubernetes environment.

---

# Prerequisites

This project deploys a local Kubernetes environment using KinD.

Required software:

- Windows host
- Docker Desktop with WSL2 backend enabled
- KinD
- kubectl
- Git

Verify installations:

```bash
docker --version
kind --version
kubectl version --client
git --version
```

---

# Deployment Workflow

The deployment follows this sequence:

1. Create KinD cluster
2. Deploy persistent storage
3. Deploy MySQL database
4. Build and deploy custom PHP/Moodle application image
5. Deploy Nginx web server
6. Configure Ingress routing
7. Verify localhost access and complete Moodle setup
8. Verify application lifecycle and persistence

---

# KinD Cluster Lifecycle Management

## Delete Existing Cluster

Use when recreating the environment from a clean state.

```bash
kind delete cluster --name lab
```

Verify the cluster has been removed:

```bash
kind get clusters
```

Optional check for leftover KinD containers:

```bash
docker ps -a | grep kind
```

---

## Create Cluster and Configure Context

Create the local KinD cluster:

```bash
kind create cluster \
  --config kubernetes/overlays/local-kind/kind-config.yaml \
  --name lab
```

Configure kubectl context:

```bash
kind export kubeconfig --name lab
```

Expected context:

```text
* kind-lab
```

Verify cluster nodes:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

Expected result:

```text
lab-control-plane
lab-worker
```

---

# Workload Deployment

## Storage Deployment

Persistent storage is deployed first because Moodle requires application data to survive container replacement.

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/storage/moodle-storage.yaml
```

Verify storage resources:

```bash
kubectl get pv
kubectl get pvc
```

---

# Database Deployment (MySQL)

Deploy the database layer:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/mysql/
```

Restart if required:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment mysql
```

Monitor startup:

```bash
kubectl get pods -w
```

---

# Build and Deploy PHP/Moodle Application

The PHP image is customized because Moodle requires additional PHP extensions and runtime configuration.

Build the custom image:

```bash
docker build -t extn-php:8.2 .
```

Load the image into the KinD cluster:

```bash
kind load docker-image extn-php:8.2 --name lab
```

Deploy PHP:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/php/
```

Restart PHP after image updates:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment php
```

Monitor startup:

```bash
kubectl get pods -w
```

Check Moodle initialization:

```bash
kubectl logs deploy/php -c init-moodle
```

---

# Nginx Web Server Deployment

Deploy the frontend web server:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/nginx/
```

Restart after configuration changes:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment nginx
```

Monitor startup:

```bash
kubectl get pods -w
```

Verify Nginx configuration:

```bash
kubectl exec deploy/nginx -- nginx -t
```

Expected:

```text
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

Inspect active routing configuration:

```bash
kubectl exec deploy/nginx -- nginx -T | grep "server_name"
```

---

# Ingress Routing

Deploy the ingress controller:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ingress-nginx.yaml
```

Wait for the ingress controller:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx -w
```

Apply Moodle ingress rules:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/overlays/local-kind/ingress.yaml
```

Verify ingress resources:

```bash
kubectl get ingress
kubectl describe ingress
```

If the admission webhook becomes stuck due to stale local cluster state:

```bash
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration ingress-nginx-admission
```

---

# Initial Application Access and Moodle Setup

## Verify Localhost Access

After the Ingress controller and Moodle ingress rules are deployed, verify that the application is reachable:

```text
http://localhost
```

Expected result:

- Moodle installation page loads in the browser.
- Nginx is successfully routing incoming traffic.
- PHP-FPM and MySQL backend connectivity is available.

---

## Complete Moodle Web Setup

Complete the Moodle installation wizard using the following values:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Web Address | `http://localhost` |
| Moodle Directory | `/var/www/html` |
| Moodle Data Directory | `/moodledata` |
| Database Type | MySQL |
| Database Host | `mysql` |
| Database Port | `3306` |
| Database Name | `moodle` |
| Database User | `<configured MySQL user>` |
| Database Password | `<configured MySQL password>` |
| Table Prefix | `mdl_` |

### Moodle Table Prefix Note

Leave the table prefix as the default:


```text
mdl_
```

The table prefix is added to Moodle database table names to identify tables belonging to this Moodle installation. For example, the default prefix `mdl_` creates tables such as `mdl_user` and `mdl_course`.

After installation, verify:

- Moodle login page loads successfully.
- Administrator login works.
- Site Administration dashboard is accessible.
- Moodle data remains available after completing setup.

---


# Deployment Lifecycle Verification

## Verify PHP Image and Application Data Persistence

This test verifies that Kubernetes can recreate the PHP workload while maintaining Moodle application data stored on persistent storage.

Before deleting the pod, verify the current PHP deployment image:

```bash
kubectl get deployment php -o jsonpath="{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}"
```

Expected:

```text
extn-php:8.2
```

Delete the PHP pod:

```bash
kubectl delete pod -l app=php
```

Verify Kubernetes creates a replacement pod:

```bash
kubectl get pods -w
```

Example result:

```text
mysql-xxxxx   1/1   Running   0   4d4h
nginx-xxxxx   1/1   Running   0   4d4h
php-yyyyy     1/1   Running   0   84s
```

The new PHP pod name and recent age confirm Kubernetes recreated the workload.

Verify Moodle application files are still available:

```bash
kubectl exec deploy/php -- ls /var/www/html
```

Expected:

```text
Existing Moodle files are still present
```

Confirm the application is still accessible:

```text
http://localhost
```

Expected:

- Moodle login page loads successfully.
- Existing configuration is preserved.
- Previously created Moodle data is available.

This confirms:

- Kubernetes recreated the PHP pod.
- The replacement pod used the expected PHP image.
- Persistent storage retained Moodle application data.
- The complete application stack recovered successfully.# Environment Reset

---

## Destroy Environment

Use when rebuilding the complete environment:

```bash
kind delete cluster --name lab
```

This removes the Kubernetes cluster, workloads, services, and pods.

---

## Reset Application Data

Use when keeping the cluster but removing persistent Moodle data:

```bash
kubectl delete pvc --all
```
If you want to restart workloads:

```bash
kubectl delete pods --all
```
---

## Remove Unused Docker Resources

Optional cleanup:

```bash
docker system prune -a --volumes -f
```
